# Wardrobe
The wardrobe application is a database-first application that uses ASP.NET MVC. A database with a outfit table was created with foreign keys linking to tops, bottoms, shoes, and accessories. The database was then connected to the MVC application and controllers were scoffolded from that information. Seperate views were created for each category (tops, bottoms, shoes, accessories), with the ability for the user to add or remove items. Within the application information is displayed about the type, color, season, and occassion for the clothing as well as a picture so that you can see at a glance what is available. Bootstrap and custom CSS help to improve the user experience.
